## Description

This is a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
so you can gauge progress compared to my other players.

When you click the start button a timer starts and the player is presented with a question.

If the answer to a question is incorrect, time is subtracted from the clock.

When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over.

When the game is over you can save your initials and score.
